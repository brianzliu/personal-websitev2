RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 

RARE AI LAB, UC SAN DIEGO	La Jolla, California
Research Intern under Prof. Aobo Li	September 2024 – Present
•	Benchmarked a range of machine learning architectures-—including vision transformers, standard 2D convolutions, graph-based spherical ConvNet (DeepSphere), and 3D convolutional autoencoders—against KamNet for neutrinoless double beta decay detection, leveraging spatial and temporal patterns in the design of the neutrino detector. Evaluated background rejection accuracy and tuned hyperparameters to identify optimize models’ efficacy.
•	Applied the RESuM surrogate modeling framework to simulation data for the COH-Ar-750 detector, enabling quantitative analysis of optimal shielding parameter configurations. Used an efficient multi-fidelity approach—combining a conditional neural process and Gaussian process—to assess neutron background rates and demonstrated that increased water shielding with thinner veto panels yields improved performance, while significantly reducing the need for computationally expensive high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations.

MAIX LAB, EMORY UNIVERSITY 	Atlanta, Georgia
Research Intern under Prof. Ran Xiao	March 2023 – November 2023
•	Evaluated 10 data compression methods using XResNet to improve heart attack diagnostics, identifying the 12-lead format for optimal performance and autoencoder for computational efficiency. Investigated orthogonal leads, vectorcardiogram (VCG), three different PCA variations, three different median beat variations, autoencoder, and binary convolutional autoencoder (BCAE)—comparing performance metrics (AUC, sensitivity, precision) against processing time. Though 12-lead format achieved highest AUC (0.926) with strong sensitivity (0.775), autoencoder demonstrated best performance-efficiency ratio (0.339), though requiring accuracy improvements for clinical deployment.

•	Constructed anatomically informed feature tensor for XResNet, resulting in significant (p<0.001) AUC increase to 93.7%. Developed regional learners for inferior, septal, anterior, and lateral ECG leads combined with a global learner using 1D convolutional layers to capture cross-lead spatial patterns—stacking features into 100-dimensional space improved myocardial infarction detection over baseline model (91.4% AUC) while achieving strong sensitivity (85.5%) and specificity (86.7%).
